CS498 Project

The files that are actually used for our website are located in the 'Web Interface Files' directory. 
The original code which inspired our project can be found under 'C++ Reference Code' and 'src'.

For the 'Web Interface Files', the website starts at home.html. We currently have it hosted at the following url:
http://www.cs.uky.edu/~jlre249/CS_498_Final_Project_Group_6/Web%20Interface%20Files/home.html

From the home page, the user can either create a new account or login as a return user. Currently, having multiple users
is untested, but a single user can successfully return to access their saved data.

Once the user has either logged in or created a new account, they have four options: (1) add assignment, (2) view assignments,
(3) add grades, (4) view grades.
